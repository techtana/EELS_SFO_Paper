## Abstract (text)

Stochiometric evolution in strontium iron oxide is of critical importance to the understanding of process-structure-property relationship of the material. In-situ electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) can be used to reveal the changes in oxidation states during the annealing process, whereby the precise spatial information of oxidation transition may be determined. However, observing stochiometric changes in the material at real-time poses challenge due to the large amount of noisy data. Machine learning methods demonstrate promise in both improving signal interpretation and automating precise control of strontium iron oxide synthesis. This paper highlights and compares the use of various deep learning architectures, both supervised and unsupervised, in classifying the oxidation states from temporal EELS data.
